\chapter*{Preface}

This report is the third document in a series of reports about the design of a Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The first document was the project plan report, followed by the baseline report. In the first document, the organisation and planning of the project was described, and the first steps were taken in the design process. In the baseline report, a market analysis is made and a large number of concepts was presented. From these, five concepts were chosen, which are further analysed in this report. This report will be followed up by a final report that discusses the preliminary design of the chosen concept.

Group 14 would like to thank Ir. J. Sinke, Dr.Ir. E. van Kampen and Ir. S. Rapp for their advise, professional assistance and feedback.

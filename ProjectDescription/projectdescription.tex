\chapter{Project Description}
\label{ch:project_description}

The aim of the Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) project is to design a UAV capable of vertical take-off and landing, and high speed horizontal flight. In addition, the UAV shall be controlled remotely within a line of sight, and ultimately beyond a visual line of sight.

\section{Requirements}

A set of requirements and constraints for the Hybrid UAV is given in the project guide \cite{dseguide}, see \autoref{tab:requ_hybr_UAV} for a summary.

\section{Description of the Entire System}
Based on the preliminary information presented in the project description document, both the Project Objective Statement (POS) and Mission Need Statement (MNS) are established.
\begin{description}
    \item[POS] To design and optimise a Hybrid UAV that meets requirements and constraints by using project management and systems engineering tools, by a team of 10 students within 11 weeks.
    \item[MNS] Carry out both supervised and autonomous monitoring and transport missions, comprising vertical take-off and landing, and high-velocity in horizontal flight.
